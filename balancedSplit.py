Question: Given an array of integers (which may include repeated integers), determine if there's a way to split the array into two subsequences A and B such that the sum of the integers in both arrays is the same, and all of the integers in A are strictly smaller than all of the integers in B.
Note: Strictly smaller denotes that every integer in A must be less than, and not equal to, every integer in B.
Signature
bool balancedSplitExists(int[] arr)
Input
All integers in array are in the range [0, 1,000,000,000].
Output
Return true if such a split is possible, and false otherwise.
Example 1
arr = [1, 5, 7, 1]
output = true
We can split the array into A = [1, 1, 5] and B = [7].
Example 2
arr = [12, 7, 6, 7, 6]
output = false
We can't split the array into A = [6, 6, 7] and B = [7, 12] since this doesn't satisfy the requirement that all integers in A are smaller than all integers in B.
